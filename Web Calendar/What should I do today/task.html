<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Nowadays, our lives are filled with many events and tasks, making it difficult to keep track of everything. To solve this problem, we can create a web calendar to store and manage all upcoming events. To achieve this, we can use the Spring Boot framework and create a REST API to save and manage events. The Spring Boot framework is perfect for building web applications with minimal setup requirements.</p>
<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5>
<p>Create a Spring Boot application object to start working with it. First, create a Spring project using Spring Boot. The following dependencies are already included in our study project in <em>build.gradle</em> file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code class="language-json">spring-boot-starter</code> — the core starter with the autoconfiguration support, logging, and YAML;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="language-json">spring-boot-starter-web</code> — the starter for building the web, including <code class="language-json">RESTful</code>, applications using Spring MVC. It uses <code class="language-json">Tomcat</code> as the default embedded container.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Create a resource that handles <code class="language-json">GET</code> requests for the <code class="language-json">/event/today</code> endpoint and sends the following JSON object as a response. The endpoint should return the response status code <code class="language-json">200</code>. Run a SpringBoot application on the <code class="language-json">28852</code> port. It is already set in the <em>application.properties</em> of the project.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Example 1: GET request for the /event/today endpoint</p>
<p><em>Response:</em> <code class="language-json">200 OK</code></p>
<p>Response body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[]</code></pre>
